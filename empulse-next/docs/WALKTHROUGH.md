# EmPulse MVP Walkthrough
**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Status:** Released

## 1. Overview
This walkthrough demonstrates the fully branded and featured EmPulse MVP. We have successfully rebranded the entire application to the lowercase `<em/pulse>` identity, polished the "Blueprint" (Whitepaper) page with high-contrast UI, and ensured the Admin Portal is fully synchronized.

## 2. Key Updates
### A. Global Rebranding (<em/pulse>)
-   **Logo:** Updated to text-based `<em/pulse>` with `#00D264` accents across Navbar, Sidebar, and Login.
-   **Consistency:** Removed dependency on old SVG logos; used scalable CSS components.
-   **Footer:** Added "EmbedIT" branding to both Main Site and Dashboard Sidebar.

### B. Blueprint Page Enhancements
-   **Visuals:** Added a high-contrast **White Card** for stats to break the dark theme monotony.
-   **CTA:** Added a strong, glowing "View Demo" button in the Hero section.
-   **Screenshots:** Populated the "Screenshots" tab with 5 real application captures:
    -   Vote Feed (Dashboard)
    -   Leaderboard
    -   Send Vote
    -   Rewards Catalog
    -   Admin Orders

### C. Admin Portal Fixes
-   **Sidebar:** Fixed the disparate Admin sidebar to match the Employee sidebar's new branding and footer.
